The <strong>CARS<\/strong> moves are as follows:<br \/><br \/><i class=\"fa fa-angle-double-right\"><\/i><strong>Establish a research territory<\/strong> to show how the research area is important and worth investigating, by introducing and reviewing previous research <br \/><i class=\"fa fa-angle-double-right\"><\/i><strong>Establish a niche<\/strong> by indicating a gap in previous research or raising questions about it<br \/><i class=\"fa fa-angle-double-right\"><\/i><strong>Occupy the niche <\/strong> by stating how one’s own research seeks to close\/fill the gap. <br \/><br \/>Following CARS will help set the scene of your research and will make it easier for others to understand your research.<br \/>For more information on how to apply CARS in your research writing please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/heta.io\/resources\/wawa-improving-research-abstracts-intros\/?target=resources\">click<\/a> here."
