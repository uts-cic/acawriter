                        AcaWriter is provided to support students and staff of UTS. Its purpose is to provide feedback on academic writing. It works by looking for specific hallmarks of good academic writing that signal that there is a significant connection being made, or an important development or contrast in ideas. This helps to demonstrate your critical thinking, skill in argument, or development as a reflective professional.
